=== Global provider

With the help of the interface *org.eclipse.microprofile.rest.client.spi.RestClientBuilderListener*, we can specify the providers which are applied to all generated rest clients.

Define the implementing class through ServiceLoader configuration, and by implementing the method _onNewBuilder_ have have the change of adding providers to the Rest client in a global way.

You no longer need to add the provider to each individual interface with the use of the @RegisterProvider annotation.
